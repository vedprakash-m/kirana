# Archived Documentation

**Date Archived:** November 2, 2025  
**Reason:** Consolidating documentation to avoid knowledge fragmentation

## Files in This Archive

### PHASE_1A_STATUS.md
Detailed status report for Phase 1A implementation. This information has been consolidated into `docs/specs/Tasks_Kirana.md`.

### PHASE_1A_COMPLETE.md
Completion summary for Phase 1A with statistics and next steps. This information has been consolidated into `docs/specs/Tasks_Kirana.md`.

### PROGRESS.md
Daily progress log. This tracking has been moved to the "Latest Implementation Notes" section in `docs/specs/Tasks_Kirana.md`.

### SETUP.md
Setup instructions for Phase 0. This information is already covered in `docs/specs/Tasks_Kirana.md` Phase 0 section and `README.md`.

## Current Documentation Structure

**Single Source of Truth:**
- `docs/specs/Tasks_Kirana.md` - All task tracking, progress updates, and implementation notes

**Product Documentation:**
- `docs/specs/PRD_Kirana.md` - Product requirements
- `docs/specs/Tech_Spec_Kirana.md` - Technical specification
- `docs/specs/UX_Kirana.md` - UX design specification
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `SETUP.md` - Setup instructions

## Why This Change?

Multiple status documents created knowledge fragmentation. By consolidating everything into `Tasks_Kirana.md`, we maintain:
- Single source of truth
- Easier to keep updated
- No conflicting information
- Better developer experience

All future updates should be made directly in `docs/specs/Tasks_Kirana.md`.
